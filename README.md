## User Story

Create a browser based version of the game ‘Rock, Paper, Scissors’.

Don't know the game? http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rock-paper-scissors

## Acceptance Criteria

- Ability to play against the computer
- Ability to simulate a game (Computer vs Computer)
- Ability to restart the game
- Computer generated plays need to be random

## Guidelines

- The UI can be as simple or as complex as you wish
- We are keen to see how much you think is enough, and how much would go into a Minimum Viable Product.  As a guide, elegant and simple wins over feature rich every time, though extra gold stars are given to people who get excited and do more because they are having fun
- We also consider the extensibility of the code produced.  Well factored code should be relatively easily extended http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rock-paper-scissors-lizard-Spock may be a natural extension
- Bonus points for vanilla JavaScript, unit tests, good accessibility, responsive design, and well commented code
- If you could show us how to test-drive your solution using TDD, that's a big plus!

## Technical Requirements

- We prefer to use vanilla Javascript and the latest EcmaScript (ES6+) features
- Using libs/frameworks is not forbidden, but we want to see your code, not someone else's
- You can style your game assets using SASS or pure CSS
- The solution should work in IE9+ and all modern browsers

### Tooling

You are free to use any tools and frameworks that you prefer. Below are some suggestions:

- `webpack` to modularise your Javascript code
- `babel` to utilise ES6+ and Stage-3 features
- `node-sass` to modularise your styling via SASS
- `eslint` to make sure your code meets the standards
- `karma`, `mocha` and `chai` to help you write and run your unit tests in various browsers
